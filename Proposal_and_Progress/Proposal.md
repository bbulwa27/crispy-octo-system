(1) Title of your project
    Funky Uno
(2) Summary of the project
    I want to create some sort of interactive card game similar to uno. I want the computer to represent multiple players so the user can have a more fun game. I also want to add some animations that are displayed throughout the game.
(3) Goal(s) for the following week.
    I want to create the deck of cards and figure out how to distribute the cards to each player.
